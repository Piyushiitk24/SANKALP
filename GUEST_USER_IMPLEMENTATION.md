# Guest User Implementation Summary

## ✅ **COMPLETED: Guest User Functionality**

### **What Was Implemented:**

1. **Frontend UI Changes:**
   - Added "Continue as Guest" button on the marketing page below "I already have an account"
   - Updated sidebar to show "Guest User" instead of UserButton for unauthenticated users
   - Created custom signin component with guest option (ready for future Clerk modal customization)

2. **Backend Architecture:**
   - Updated middleware to allow guest access to all learning routes (`/learn`, `/courses`, `/lesson/*`, etc.)
   - Created guest user management system using localStorage for client-side persistence
   - Updated database queries to handle both authenticated and guest users seamlessly

3. **Guest User Management:**
   - **GuestUser Type**: Includes id, userName, userImageSrc, activeCourseId, hearts, points, and activeCourse data
   - **localStorage Persistence**: Guest progress is stored locally and persists across browser sessions
   - **Automatic Guest Creation**: When accessing learning routes without authentication, a guest user is created automatically
   - **Course Selection Flow**: Guest users are prompted to select a course before accessing learning content

4. **Database Integration:**
   - **Public API Endpoint**: `/api/public/courses` for fetching course data without authentication
   - **Server Actions**: Updated all user progress actions (reduceHearts, refillHearts, etc.) to handle guest users
   - **Query Updates**: Modified getUserProgress, getUnits, and other queries to work with guest users
   - **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support for both guest and authenticated user types

5. **Feature Compatibility:**
   - **Hearts System**: Guest users have hearts that decrease on wrong answers and can be refilled
   - **Points System**: Guest users can earn and spend points (stored locally)
   - **Course Progress**: Guest users can progress through lessons and units
   - **Leaderboard**: Guest users can view leaderboards (though their progress isn't saved to database)
   - **Shop**: Guest users can access the shop (transactions handled locally)

### **User Experience Flow:**

1. **Guest Entry Points:**
   - Marketing page: "Continue as Guest" button
   - Direct URL access to learning routes (auto-creates guest user)

2. **Course Selection:**
   - Guest users see a course selection interface
   - Choose from available courses with visual previews
   - Course selection is validated server-side

3. **Learning Experience:**
   - Full access to lessons, quizzes, and challenges
   - Hearts and points work exactly like authenticated users
   - Progress persists in localStorage across sessions
   - Clear indication of guest status with upgrade prompts

4. **Limitations & Upgrade Path:**
   - Guest progress isn't saved permanently (localStorage only)
   - Clear messaging about temporary nature of guest progress
   - Easy upgrade path with "Back to Sign Up" buttons

### **Technical Details:**

- **Guest User ID Format**: `guest_${timestamp}_${randomString}`
- **Data Storage**: Browser localStorage with JSON serialization
- **Server Integration**: Server actions gracefully handle guest vs authenticated users
- **Type Safety**: Complete TypeScript coverage with discriminated unions
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for localStorage operations

### **Files Modified/Created:**

**New Files:**
- `lib/guest-user.ts` - Guest user management utilities
- `components/guest-user-handler.tsx` - Guest user session management
- `components/guest-course-selection.tsx` - Course selection for guests
- `components/auth/custom-signin.tsx` - Custom signin with guest option
- `app/api/public/courses/route.ts` - Public course data endpoint
- `actions/user-progress.ts` - Added `selectCourseAsGuest` action

**Modified Files:**
- `middleware.ts` - Added public routes for guest access
- `app/(marketing)/page.tsx` - Added "Continue as Guest" button
- `app/(main)/layout.tsx` - Integrated guest user handler
- `components/sidebar.tsx` - Added guest user UI
- `db/queries.ts` - Updated for guest user compatibility
- `actions/user-progress.ts` - Updated all actions for guest users

### **Build Status:**

- ✅ All TypeScript types resolved
- ✅ Full feature compatibility

The guest user system is now fully functional and provides a seamless way for users to experience the platform without requiring account creation, while maintaining a clear upgrade path for permanent data persistence.
